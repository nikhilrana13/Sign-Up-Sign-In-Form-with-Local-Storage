# Sign-Up-Sign-In-Form-with-Local-Storage
This project demonstrates a simple user authentication system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a sign-up and sign-in form that handles user data and performs validations as follows: 
Sign-Up Form: Allows users to enter their username, email, and password. The data is saved in the browser's local storage for future use.

Sign-In Form: Users can log in using their email and password. The form validates the credentials against the data stored in local storage.

Validation Checks:
Displays "Login Successful" if the credentials match the stored data.
Shows "Wrong Email or Password" if the credentials do not match.
Alerts "All fields are required" if any field is left blank.
Displays "User not found" if the email does not match any stored user.
This project is a great example of using local storage for client-side data management and provides basic authentication functionalities.

Feel free to modify it according to your preferences!
